#FaceRec - (WIP)



As an integral part of a learning journey, this application harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to perform facial, speech, and image recognition algorithms. The underlying framework allows users to experiment with various models from the Clarifai platform.

The primary objectives of this application encompass:

Testing AI API and Exploring Functionality:
Examination and experimentation with the AI API are undertaken to  understand its capabilities and functionalities.

Defining Application Possibilities:
The application serves as a platform to extract and define potential use cases, exploring how AI can be strategically integrated into future projects.

Enhancing AI Utilization Knowledge:
The project is designed to extend knowledge and proficiency in leveraging AI more efficiently, with a focus on staying current with industry advancements.

In frontend development, the application beyond basic React functionalities, incorporates advanced features such as state management through React Hooks, the Context API, and Redux integration. This approach ensures a robust and scalable frontend architecture that aligns with best practices.

On the backend, Node.js with the Express library forms the foundation, providing a scalable and efficient server environment. Persistent data is stored in a Postgre database connected to the backend, with API calls originating from this server. Testing protocols, including the use of Jest, are employed to ensure the reliability of the application.

Security measures are implemented utilizing Redis and sessions in conjunction with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This multifaceted security approach aims to safeguard sensitive information and fortify the overall integrity of the application. 

Although most functionalities are already implemented some parts are still a work in progress.
